    "# Kaggle Titanic survival - TensorFlow 'sequential' neural net.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we build a neural network to predict survival. The two common frameworks used for neural networks (as of 2020) are TensorFlow and PyTorch. Both are excellent frameworks. TensorFlow frequently requires fewer lines of code, but PyTorch is more natively Python in its syntax, and also allows for easier debugging as the model may be interrupted, with a breakpoint, and debugged as necessary. This makes PyTorch particularly suitable for research and experimentation. A disadvantage of using PyTorch is that, compared with TensorFlow, there are fewer training materials and examples available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use 'keras' which is integrated into TensorFlow and makes it simpler and faster to build TensorFlow models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both TensorFlow and PyTorch allow the neural network to be trained on a GPU, which is beneficial for large neural networks (especially those processing image, sound or free-text data). In order to lever the benefits of GPU (which perform many calculations simultaneously), data is grouped into batches. These batches are presented to the CPU in a single object called a Tensor (a multi-dimensional array). \n",
    "\n",
    "To install TensorFlow as a new environment in Anaconda type the following from a terminal\n",
    "`conda create -n tensorflow tensorflow && conda install -n tensorflow scikit-learn pandas matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or PIP install with:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install --upgrade pip`\n",
    "`pip install tensorflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest release of TensorFlow supports CPU and GPU, If using an older installation then use `tensorflow-gpu` in place of `tensorflow` to install a gpu-capable version of TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from Anaconda Navigator, select the TensorFlow environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of this workbook. This version uses a simpler form of constructing the neural network. The alternative version uses an API-based method which offers some more flexibility (but at the cost of a little simplicity). It is recommended to work through both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the intention here to describe neural networks in any detail, but rather give some introductory code to using a neural network for a classification problem. For an introduction to neural networks see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for PyTorch here keeps all calculations on the CPU rather than passing to a GPU (if you have one). Running neural networks on CPUs is fine for structured data such as our Titanic data. GPUs come in to their own for unstructured data like images, sound clips, or free text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process of a neural network consists of three general phases which are repeated across all the data. All of the data is passed through the network multiple times (the number of iterations, which may be as few as 3-5 or may be 100+). The three phases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pass training X data to the network and predict y\n",
    "* Calculate the 'loss' (error) between the predicted and observed (actual) values of y\n",
    "* Adjust the network a little (as defined by the learning rate) so that the error is reduced. The correction of the network is performed by PyTorch or TensorFlow using a technique called 'back-propagation'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning is repeated until maximum accuracy is achieved (but keep an eye on accuracy of test data as well as training data as the network may develop significant over-fitting to training data unless steps are taken to offset the potential for over-fitting, such as use of 'drop-out' layers described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Neural Networks are most often used for complex unstructured data. For structured data, other techniques, such as Random Forest,s may frequently be preferred."

    "Here we use the `sequential` method to set up a TensorFlow neural network. This simpler method assumes each layer occurs in sequence. Though simpler, it lacks some flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will put construction of the neural net into a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural net is a relatively simple network. The inputs are connected to two hidden layers (of 240 and 50 nodes) before being connected to two output nodes corresponding to each class (died and survived). It also contains some useful additions (batch normalisation and dropout) as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers of the network are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) An input layer (which does not need to be defined) \n",
    "\n",
    "2) A fully-connected (dense) layer.This is defined by the number of inputs (the number of input features) and the number of outputs. We will expand out feature data set up to 240 outputs. The output of the layer uses ReLU  (rectified linear unit) activation. ReLU activation is most common for the inner layers of a neural network. Negative input values are set to zero. Positive input values are left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A batch normalisation layer. This is not usually used for small models, but can increase the speed of training for larger models. It is added here as an example of how to include it (in large models all dense layers would be followed by a batch normalisation layer). The layer definition includes the number of inputs to normalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A dropout layer. This layer randomly sets outputs from the preceding layer to zero during training (a different set of outputs is zeroed for each training iteration). This helps prevent over-fitting of the model to the training data. Typically between 0.1 and 0.3 outputs are set to zero (`p=0.1` means 10% of outputs are set to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "5) A second fully connected layer which reduces the network down to 50 nodes. This again uses ReLU activation and is followed by batch normalisation, and dropout layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) A final fully connected linear layer of one nodes (more nodes could be used for more classes, in which case use `softmax` activation and `categorical_crossentropy` in the loss function).\n",
