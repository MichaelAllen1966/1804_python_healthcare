    "# Kaggle Titanic survival - Receiever Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently in machine learning we wish to go beyond measuring raw accuracy. This is especially true when classes are unbalanced, where errors are often greater in one class than the other. The Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve allows us to better understand the trade-off between sensitivity (the ability to detect positives of a certain class) and specificity (the ability to detect negatives of a certain class). The area under the ROC curve is also often used to compare different models: a higher Area Under Curve (AUC) is frequently the sign of a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity or recall. The false-positive rate can be calculated as (1 − specificity).\n",

This, like our method above, runs the model once to predict the survival probablities, and constructs the curve from those."
